# Problem 3 - Matrix Diagonals

- In the previous step, you obtained a **string of length 864**.
Your objective is to split this **864-length string into six parts**, each of **144 length**.

- Represent each 144-length string as a **12x12 matrix**.
Identify and extract the **diagonal elements** of each matrix.
Concatenate these diagonal elements to form a 72 length string.
