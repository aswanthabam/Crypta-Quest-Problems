- Next, you need to add the two matrices to form a new matrix. 
- Then, replace the elements in the matrix with the remainder when divided by 26 (find its modulus by 26).
- Afterward, convert the numbers back to its assigned characters (refer to the previous image).
- convert it to a 36 length string and submit it.
